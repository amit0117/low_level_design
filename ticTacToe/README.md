# Tic-Tac-Toe Game System

A comprehensive Low-Level Design (LLD) implementation of a tic-tac-toe game system using Python, demonstrating advanced object-oriented design principles, design patterns, and concurrent programming techniques.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

This tic-tac-toe system implements a robust, scalable architecture using multiple design patterns:

### Core Design Patterns Used

1. **State Pattern** - Manages game states (NotStarted, InProgress, Completed)
2. **Observer Pattern** - Notifies players about game status changes
3. **Strategy Pattern** - Implements different win detection algorithms
4. **Factory Pattern** - Creates players and game components

### Key Components

‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ observers/        # Observer pattern implementation
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ game_observer.py # Subject/Observer base classes
```

## üéÆ Game Features

### Game States

- **NotStarted State**: Game initialization and setup
- **InProgress State**: Active gameplay with move validation
- **Completed State**: Game over with winner determination

### Player Types

- **Human Player**: Interactive input-based moves
- **Computer Player**: Automated random move selection

### Board Configurations

- **Standard 3x3**: Classic tic-tac-toe (3 in a row to win)
- **Custom Sizes**: Support for NxN boards
- **Flexible Win Conditions**: K consecutive symbols to win (K ‚â§ N)

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```python
from tic_tac_toe_game import TicTacToeGame

# Create a game
game = TicTacToeGame(board_size=3, consecutive_moves_to_win=3)

# Play human vs computer
game.play_game(
    player1_type="human",
    player2_type="computer",
    player1_name="Human Player",
    player2_name="AI Assistant"
)
```

### Programmatic Control

```python
# Initialize players
game.initialize_players("Alice", "Bob", "human", "computer")

# Start game
game.start_game()

# Make moves
game.make_move(0, 0)  # Human player move
game.make_move()      # Computer player move (automatic)

# Check game status
if game.is_game_over():
    winner = game.get_winner()
    if winner:
        print(f"{winner.get_name()} wins!")
    else:
        print("It's a draw!")
```

## üéØ Design Principles Applied

### SOLID Principles

- **Single Responsibility**: Each class has one clear purpose
- **Open/Closed**: Easy to add new game states and player types
- **Liskov Substitution**: All state implementations are interchangeable
- **Interface Segregation**: Clean, focused interfaces
- **Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules depend on abstractions

### Additional Principles

- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Reusable components
- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**: Clear, understandable code
- **YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)**: Only implemented required features

## üìä Game Behavior

### Win Detection Algorithm

The system implements a comprehensive win detection algorithm that checks:

1. **Horizontal Wins**: Consecutive symbols in rows
2. **Vertical Wins**: Consecutive symbols in columns
3. **Diagonal Wins**: Consecutive symbols in main diagonals
4. **Anti-Diagonal Wins**: Consecutive symbols in anti-diagonals

### State Transitions

```
NotStarted State
    ‚Üì (start())
InProgress State
    ‚Üì (win/draw condition met)
Completed State
```

### Move Validation

- **Boundary Checks**: Row/column within board limits
- **Occupancy Checks**: Cell must be empty
- **State Validation**: Moves only allowed in InProgress state

## üß™ Demo Scenarios

The system includes comprehensive demos showcasing:

1. **Human vs Computer**: Interactive gameplay experience
2. **Computer vs Computer**: Automated gameplay demonstration
3. **Large Board (4-in-a-row)**: 5x5 board with 4 consecutive symbols to win
4. **Large Board (3-in-a-row)**: 5x5 board with 3 consecutive symbols to win
5. **Manual Control**: Programmatic game control
6. **State Transitions**: State pattern demonstration
7. **Observer Pattern**: Player notification system
8. **Error Handling**: Invalid moves and edge cases

### Running Demos

```bash
cd low_level_design/ticTacToe
python3 demo.py
```

## üéØ Implementation Details

### State Pattern Usage

```python
# Game state management
game.set_state(NotStartedState())    # Initial state
game.start()                         # Transitions to InProgressState
# Game logic handled by current state
game.end()                          # Transitions to CompletedState
```

### Observer Pattern Implementation

```python
# Players observe game status changes
game.add_observer(player1)
game.add_observer(player2)

# Game status changes notify all observers
game.set_status(GameStatus.IN_PROGRESS)  # All players notified
```

### Win Detection Strategy

```python
# Comprehensive win checking for all directions
def check_winner(self, player: Player, row: int, col: int) -> bool:
    # Check horizontal, vertical, diagonal, and anti-diagonal
    return (self._check_horizontal(player, row) or
            self._check_vertical(player, col) or
            self._check_diagonal(player, row, col) or
            self._check_anti_diagonal(player, row, col))
```

## üîß Configuration Options

### Board Sizes

```python
# Standard 3x3
game = TicTacToeGame(board_size=3, consecutive_moves_to_win=3)

# Large 5x5 board with 4-in-a-row
game = TicTacToeGame(board_size=5, consecutive_moves_to_win=4)

# Large 5x5 board with 3-in-a-row (easier to win)
game = TicTacToeGame(board_size=5, consecutive_moves_to_win=3)

# Custom configurations
game = TicTacToeGame(board_size=4, consecutive_moves_to_win=3)
```

### Player Configurations

```python
# Different player combinations
game.initialize_players("Alice", "Bob", "human", "human")
game.initialize_players("Human", "AI", "human", "computer")
game.initialize_players("AI1", "AI2", "computer", "computer")
```
