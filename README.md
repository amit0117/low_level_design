## 🎓 What is Low Level Design?

**Low Level Design (LLD)** focuses on the detailed design of individual components, classes, and their interactions. It bridges the gap between High Level Design (system architecture) and actual code implementation.

### Key Aspects of LLD:

1. **Class Design** - Defining classes, their attributes, and methods
2. **Design Patterns** - Applying appropriate patterns to solve problems
3. **SOLID Principles** - Writing maintainable, extensible code
4. **Data Structures** - Choosing the right data structures for efficiency
5. **API Design** - Designing clean, intuitive interfaces
6. **Error Handling** - Robust exception handling and validation
7. **Thread Safety** - Handling concurrent operations correctly

## 🏗️ Architecture Principles

### SOLID Principles

All projects follow SOLID principles:

- **S**ingle Responsibility - Each class has one reason to change
- **O**pen/Closed - Open for extension, closed for modification
- **L**iskov Substitution - Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types
- **I**nterface Segregation - Clients shouldn't depend on interfaces they don't use
- **D**ependency Inversion - Depend on abstractions, not concretions

### Clean Architecture

Projects follow layered architecture:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│      Presentation/Demo Layer    │
│      (demo.py, run.py)          │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
              │
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│         Service Layer           │

└─────────────────────────────────┘
              │

┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│        Domain Layer             │
│    (Models, Entities)           │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
              │
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
