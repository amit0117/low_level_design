## 🏗️ Architecture

### Design Patterns

#### Singleton Pattern

The `ParkingLot`, `TicketRepository`, and `GateRepository` classes ensure single instances:

```python
class ParkingLot:
    _lock = Lock()
    _instance: "ParkingLot" = None

    def __new__(cls):
        if cls._instance is None:
            with cls._lock:
                if cls._instance is None:
                    cls._instance = super().__new__(cls)
        return cls._instance
```

**Benefits**:

- Single parking lot instance across the application
- Thread-safe implementation with double-checked locking
- Centralized access point for all parking operations
- Prevents multiple parking lot instances from conflicting

**Use Case**: Ensures that only one parking lot instance exists, maintaining consistency in floor management, gate management, and ticket handling.

#### Strategy Pattern

The system uses Strategy pattern for three key algorithms:

1. **ParkingSpotAssignmentStrategy**: How to assign spots
   - `RandomSpotAssignmentStrategy`: Random assignment
   - Can extend: NearestSpotAssignmentStrategy, FirstComeFirstServeStrategy, ZoneBasedStrategy

2. **PaymentStrategy**: How to process payments
   - `CashPaymentStrategy`: Cash payment
   - Can extend: CreditCardPaymentStrategy, DebitCardPaymentStrategy, UPIPaymentStrategy

3. **PricingStrategy**: How to calculate prices
   - `FlatRatePricingStrategy`: Fixed rate
   - `HourlyPricingStrategy`: Time-based pricing
   - Can extend: PeakHourPricingStrategy, VIPPricingStrategy

```python
class ParkingLot:
    def __init__(self):
        self.parking_spot_assignment_strategy = RandomSpotAssignmentStrategy()
        self.payment_strategy = CashPaymentStrategy()
        self.pricing_strategy = FlatRatePricingStrategy()

    def allocate_parking_spot(self, vehicle: Vehicle):
        # Uses current strategy
        return self.parking_spot_assignment_strategy.assign_parking_spot(...)
```

**Benefits**:

- Easy to switch algorithms at runtime
- Extensible without modifying existing code
- Follows Open/Closed Principle
- Clean separation of concerns

#### Repository Pattern

Repositories manage domain objects:

- **TicketRepository**: Manages all parking tickets (Singleton)
- **GateRepository**: Manages all entry and exit gates (Singleton)

```python
class TicketRepository:
    _instance = None
    _lock = Lock()

    def __new__(cls):
        if cls._instance is None:
            with cls._lock:
                if cls._instance is None:
                    cls._instance = super().__new__(cls)
        return cls._instance

    def create_ticket(self, vehicle, parking_spot, entry_gate, floor):
        ticket = Ticket(vehicle, parking_spot, entry_gate, floor)
        self.tickets[ticket.get_ticket_id()] = ticket
        return ticket
```

**Benefits**:

- Centralized data management
- Single source of truth
- Easy to swap implementations (e.g., database-backed)
- Clean API for data access

#### Template Method Pattern

Gates follow a consistent processing flow:

**EntryGate Template**:
1. Allocate parking spot
2. Create ticket
3. Park vehicle
4. Return ticket

**ExitGate Template**:
1. Get ticket
2. Calculate price
3. Process payment
4. Update ticket
5. Unpark vehicle
6. Return payment response

```python
class EntryGate(Gate):
    def process_entry(self, vehicle: Vehicle) -> Ticket:
        # Template method flow
        floor_number, parking_spot = parking_lot.allocate_parking_spot(vehicle)
        ticket = parking_lot.create_ticket(vehicle, parking_spot, ...)
        floor = parking_lot.get_floor(floor_number)
        floor.park_vehicle(parking_spot.get_spot_number(), vehicle)
        return ticket
```

**Benefits**:

- Consistent processing flow
- Easy to extend with new gate types
- Centralized error handling
- Follows DRY principle

### Lock Management Architecture

The system uses a hybrid lock management approach:

#### Problem Statement

1. **Global Lock**: Too coarse-grained, poor concurrency
2. **Per-Spot Lock**: Too many locks, memory overhead
3. **Per-Floor Lock**: Better balance, but still limits concurrency

#### Solution: Hybrid LockManager

```python
class LockManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.spot_locks: dict[int, Lock] = defaultdict(Lock)
        self._manager_lock = Lock()

    @contextmanager
    def acquire(self, spot_id: int):
        lock = self.get_lock(spot_id)
        lock.acquire()
        try:
            yield
        finally:
            lock.release()
```

**Features**:

- **Per-Floor Scoped**: Each Floor has its own LockManager
- **Lazy Creation**: Locks created on-demand (not pre-allocated)
- **Fine-Grained**: Per-spot locking for maximum concurrency
- **Thread-Safe**: Manager lock prevents race conditions in lock creation

**Benefits**:

- Optimal concurrency: Multiple vehicles can park on different floors/spots simultaneously
- Memory Efficient: Only creates locks for spots that are accessed
- Scalable: Can scale to thousands of spots per floor
- Distributed-Ready: Can be replaced with Redis/ZooKeeper for distributed systems

### Use Cases for Design Patterns

#### Singleton Pattern

- **Single Parking Lot**: Ensures only one parking lot instance exists
- **Centralized Management**: All parking operations go through single instance
- **Resource Efficiency**: Prevents duplicate repositories and resource allocation
- **Thread Safety**: Safe concurrent access with double-checked locking

#### Strategy Pattern

- **Spot Assignment**: Easy to switch between assignment algorithms
- **Payment Methods**: Support multiple payment methods (Cash, Card, UPI)
- **Pricing Models**: Support different pricing strategies (Flat, Hourly, Peak)

#### Repository Pattern

- **Ticket Management**: Centralized ticket storage and retrieval
- **Gate Management**: Centralized gate registration and access
- **Future Extensibility**: Easy to swap with database-backed repositories

#### Template Method Pattern

- **Gate Processing**: Consistent entry/exit processing flow
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new gate types (VIP Gate, Emergency Gate)
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling and rollback
